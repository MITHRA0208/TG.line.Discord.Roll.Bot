You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice.

Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>",

Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance.

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p>\r\n<p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>\r\n<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it.

On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</p>\r\n<p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>"

Distance off target is 1d10 &times; 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"
